## üìù Notes

- This is a MASSIVE undertaking - essentially reimplementing Whisper from scratch
- No existing solution does this - we'd be first
- High risk but potentially huge reward (true hardware acceleration)
- Consider hybrid approach: critical path on iGPU, rest on CPU
- May need Intel engineering support for optimal performance
