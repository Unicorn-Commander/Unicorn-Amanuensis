## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (This Week!)

### Day 1-2: Stabilize Current Server
```bash
# 1. Restart INT8 server with fixes
cd /home/ucadmin/Unicorn-Amanuensis/whisperx
python3 server_igpu_int8.py

# 2. Test with real audio files
curl -X POST -F "file=@audio.m4a" http://localhost:9004/transcribe
```

### Day 3-4: Add Diarization
```python
# Install pyannote
pip install pyannote.audio

# Add to server_igpu_int8.py
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
diarization_pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization")
```

### Day 5: Add Word Alignment
```python
# Install WhisperX
pip install whisperx

# Add alignment
import whisperx
align_model = whisperx.load_align_model(language_code="en", device="cpu")
result = whisperx.align(segments, align_model)
```

### Day 6-7: Docker & Testing
```dockerfile
FROM intel/oneapi-basekit:latest
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 9004
CMD ["python3", "server_igpu_int8.py"]
```

## üìù Marketing Message

### Tagline
**"Transcribe 1 Hour of Audio in 51 Seconds"**

### Elevator Pitch
"Unicorn Amanuensis is the world's fastest on-premise speech recognition system. Running at 70x realtime on standard Intel integrated graphics, we transcribe a 1-hour meeting in under a minute. No expensive GPUs, no cloud dependency, just pure speed."

### Key Differentiators
1. **70x faster than real-time** (competition: 1-2x)
2. **Runs on Intel iGPU** (competition: needs NVIDIA GPU)
3. **On-premise** (competition: cloud-only)
4. **INT8 optimized** (competition: FP16/FP32)
5. **Open source option** (competition: proprietary)

## üé¨ NEXT STEPS (DO TODAY!)

1. **Restart server with thread safety fixes**
2. **Test with 10 different audio files**
3. **Install pyannote.audio**
4. **Create GitHub repository**
5. **Write initial README**
