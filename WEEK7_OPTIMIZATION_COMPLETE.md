- CPU time profiling (mel: 10-15ms, decoder: 17-22ms)
- NPU utilization measurement (0.8%, severely under-utilized)
- Bottleneck identification and prioritization

**Key Findings**:
- Total latency: 64ms (468x realtime) ✅ Meets target
- Allocation overhead: 3-6ms (80% reducible)
- Copy overhead: 3-4ms (50-75% reducible)
- NPU has 97% headroom (0.8% → 15% achievable)

## Bottleneck Analysis

### Critical Bottlenecks (HIGH Priority)

1. **Memory Allocations** (3-6ms overhead)
   - 16-24 allocations per request
   - Hotspots: mel spectrogram (960KB), FFT buffer (9.6MB)
   - Solution: Buffer pooling → -80% overhead
   - Priority: **HIGH**

2. **Data Copies** (3-4ms overhead)
   - Hotspot: `np.ascontiguousarray()` (1ms)
   - Hotspot: CPU→GPU transfer (2ms, if using GPU)
   - Solution: Zero-copy → -50-75% overhead
   - Priority: **HIGH**

3. **NPU Under-utilization** (0.8% usage)
   - Encoder idle 99.2% of time
   - Solution: Multi-stream pipeline → 15% utilization
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**

### Non-Bottlenecks

4. **NUMA Allocation**
   - System: Single NUMA node (node 0)
   - NPU: Reports node -1 (integrated or not NUMA-aware)
   - Conclusion: **No optimization needed**
