## Executive Summary

This roadmap consolidates all performance optimization analyses and provides a prioritized implementation plan for Week 7 and beyond. The optimizations target memory efficiency, data copy elimination, and concurrent request handling to achieve maximum NPU utilization and minimum latency.

### Current Performance Status

| Metric | Current Value | Target | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Latency (30s audio) | 64ms | <75ms | ✅ **PASS** |
| Realtime Factor | 468x | 400-500x | ✅ **PASS** |
| Throughput (sequential) | 15.6 req/s | 15+ req/s | ✅ **PASS** |
| NPU Utilization | 0.8% | 2-3% | ⚠️ **UNDER-UTILIZED** |
| Memory per Request | 15-20MB | <25MB | ✅ **PASS** |

**Verdict**: Service meets performance targets but has significant optimization headroom.

### Optimization Potential Summary

| Optimization | Latency Impact | Throughput Impact | Complexity | Priority |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| **Buffer Pooling** | **-1.8-4.8ms** | **+5-10%** | Medium | **HIGH** |
| **Zero-Copy** | **-2-3ms** | **+3-5%** | Low | **HIGH** |
| **Multi-Stream** | **~0ms** | **+300-400%** | High | **MEDIUM** |
| **NUMA Opt** | **N/A** | **N/A** | N/A | **NOT APPLICABLE** |

**Total Improvement Potential**:
- **Latency**: 64ms → 50-55ms (**-14-22% latency**)
- **Realtime Factor**: 468x → 545-600x (**+16-28%**)
- **Throughput**: 15.6 req/s → 60-80 req/s (**+285-413%** with multi-stream)

## Detailed Optimization Analysis

### 1. Buffer Pooling ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem**: Each request allocates 15-20MB of memory, causing fragmentation and GC overhead.

**Solution**: Pre-allocated buffer pools for mel spectrograms, audio, encoder outputs.

**Implementation**:
- Create `buffer_pool.py` with `BufferPool` and `GlobalBufferManager` classes
- Modify `server.py` to acquire/release buffers instead of allocating
- Configure pools: mel (960KB × 10), audio (960KB × 5), encoder (960KB × 5)

**Expected Impact**:
- **Latency**: -1.8-4.8ms (80% allocation overhead reduction)
- **Throughput**: +5-10% (fewer GC pauses)
- **Memory**: Peak usage capped at ~50MB (vs unbounded)
- **Fragmentation**: -70-80%

**Effort**: 10 hours (design complete, ready to implement)

**Files**:
- `buffer_pool.py` (500 lines, new)
- `xdna2/server.py` (modified)
- `tests/test_buffer_pool.py` (300 lines, new)

**Deliverable**: `/home/ccadmin/CC-1L/npu-services/unicorn-amanuensis/BUFFER_POOL_DESIGN.md`

---

### 2. Zero-Copy Optimization ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem**: 6 avoidable data copies per request (3-4ms overhead).

**Solution**: Eliminate copies via:
1. Direct mel computation into pre-allocated C-contiguous buffer
2. CPU-only decoder (no GPU transfer)
3. Strided array support in C++ encoder (optional)

**Implementation**:
- Create `mel_utils.py` with optimized mel computation
- Modify `server.py` to use output buffers
- Set `DEVICE='cpu'` for decoder (eliminate 2ms CPU→GPU copy)

**Expected Impact**:
- **Latency**: -2-3ms (50-75% copy overhead reduction)
- **Throughput**: +3-5%
- **Copies**: 11 → 8 per request

**Effort**: 6-7 hours (design complete, ready to implement)

**Files**:
- `xdna2/mel_utils.py` (200 lines, new)
- `xdna2/server.py` (modified)
- `xdna2/encoder_cpp.py` (add output parameter)

**Deliverable**: `/home/ccadmin/CC-1L/npu-services/unicorn-amanuensis/ZERO_COPY_OPTIMIZATION.md`

---

### 3. Multi-Stream Pipelining 🔶 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Problem**: NPU is idle 99.2% of the time (0.8% utilization).

**Solution**: Multi-stage pipeline with concurrent workers:
- Stage 1: Audio Load + Mel (4 thread workers)
- Stage 2: Encoder (1 NPU worker, serialized)
- Stage 3: Decoder + Alignment (4 process workers)

**Implementation**:
- Create `request_queue.py` with priority queue
- Create `pipeline_workers.py` with pipeline stages
- Create `transcription_pipeline.py` with complete pipeline
- Modify `api.py` to use pipeline

**Expected Impact**:
- **Latency**: ~0ms (individual request latency unchanged)
- **Throughput**: 15.6 → 60-80 req/s (+285-413%)
- **NPU Utilization**: 0.8% → 12-15% (+15-18x)
- **Concurrent Requests**: 1 → 10-15

**Effort**: 12-16 hours (design complete, implement after buffer pool)

**Files**:
- `request_queue.py` (200 lines, new)
- `pipeline_workers.py` (300 lines, new)
- `transcription_pipeline.py` (400 lines, new)
- `api.py` (modified)

**Deliverable**: `/home/ccadmin/CC-1L/npu-services/unicorn-amanuensis/MULTI_STREAM_PIPELINING.md`

---

### 4. NUMA Optimization ❌ NOT APPLICABLE

**Analysis**:
- System has single NUMA node (node 0, 122GB RAM)
- NPU reports NUMA node -1 (not NUMA-aware or integrated design)
- All memory already on same NUMA node as CPUs

**Conclusion**: No optimization needed. Skip this task.

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

1. **Buffer Pooling**: Mature pattern, well-tested design
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive unit tests
   - Fallback: Gradual rollout (pool for mel only first)

2. **Zero-Copy**: Simple changes, validated approach
   - Mitigation: Verify with memory profiler
   - Fallback: Keep original code path as fallback

### Medium Risk

3. **Multi-Stream Pipeline**: More complex, new architecture
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing before production
   - Fallback: Keep sequential pipeline as option

### Known Limitations

1. **NPU Serialization**: Current design limits NPU to 1 request at a time
   - Future: Investigate multi-tile parallel execution
   - Timeline: Week 9+ (research required)

2. **GIL Limitations**: Python GIL limits CPU parallelism
   - Mitigation: Use process pools for decoder stage
   - Already incorporated in multi-stream design
