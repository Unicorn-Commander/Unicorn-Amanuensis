If automatic download doesn't work, you can:

1. Download models manually from HuggingFace:
   - https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
   - https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0
   - https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb

2. Place them in: /models/pyannote/

3. The service will use them locally without internet connection.

Note: These models are for research/non-commercial use by default.
For commercial use, check the model licenses.
