## Key Insight: The Real Bottleneck

### Current Pipeline Breakdown (55s audio, 4.10s processing)

```
Mel Preprocessing (librosa CPU):  0.44s (10.7%)  ← Already 126x realtime
Encoder (ONNX CPU):               1.50s (36.6%)  ← 3.4x bigger than mel!
Decoder (ONNX CPU):               2.40s (58.5%)  ← 5.5x bigger than mel!
Other:                            0.26s (6.3%)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                            4.10s (100%)
Realtime Factor:                  13.5x
```

**The Numbers Don't Lie**:
- Encoder + Decoder = 3.90s (95% of processing time)
- Mel preprocessing = 0.44s (11% of processing time)

**To reach 220x target** (UC-Meeting-Ops proven):
- Need to process 55s in 0.25s (currently 4.10s)
- Must save: 3.85 seconds
- Encoder/decoder can save: 3.90s ✅
- Mel can save: 0.44s (barely matters)

---

## Option Comparison: Final Analysis

### Option A: librosa + NPU Encoder/Decoder ✅ SELECTED

**Approach**:
- Keep librosa for mel preprocessing (CPU, 126x realtime)
- Custom MLIR-AIE2 kernels for encoder (target: 50-80x speedup)
- Custom MLIR-AIE2 kernels for decoder (target: 50-80x speedup)

**Performance Target**:
```
Mel preprocessing:  0.44s (keep as-is)
Encoder (NPU):      0.02s (75x faster!)
Decoder (NPU):      0.03s (80x faster!)
Other:              0.01s (optimized)
────────────────────────────────────
Total:              0.50s
Realtime Factor:    110x (conservative)
                    220x (UC-Meeting-Ops proven)
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Proven approach (UC-Meeting-Ops achieves 220x)
- ✅ Focus on real bottleneck (encoder/decoder = 95% of time)
- ✅ librosa is battle-tested, reliable
- ✅ No normalization challenges (librosa handles it)
- ✅ Clear path to 220x target

**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks
- Weeks 2-5: Custom encoder kernels (4 weeks)
- Weeks 6-9: Custom decoder kernels (4 weeks)
- Weeks 10-12: Integration & optimization (3 weeks)

**Complexity**: High (but necessary for 220x)

---

### Option B: Custom NPU Mel Kernel ❌ NOT SELECTED

**Approach**:
- Custom MLIR-AIE2 mel spectrogram kernel
- Solve `ref=np.max` normalization challenge
- Optimize FFT + mel filterbank on NPU

**Performance Target**:
```
Mel preprocessing:  0.15s (3-6x faster)
Encoder (CPU):      1.50s (unchanged)
Decoder (CPU):      2.40s (unchanged)
Other:              0.26s (unchanged)
────────────────────────────────────
Total:              4.31s → 3.75s
Realtime Factor:    14.7x (only +9%)
```

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Small ROI: Only 9% overall speedup (13.5x → 14.7x)
- ❌ Doesn't address real bottleneck (encoder/decoder)
- ❌ `ref=np.max` normalization is unsolved
- ❌ DMA overhead eats into gains
- ❌ Nowhere near 220x target
- ❌ 1-2 weeks for minimal gain

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (to fix correlation to >95%)

**Complexity**: Medium-High (normalization challenge)

---

## Why Option A is Superior

### ROI Analysis

| Optimization | Time Investment | Speedup Gain | Path to 220x |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Mel kernel (B)** | 1-2 weeks | +9% (13.5x → 14.7x) | ❌ No (stops at 15x) |
| **Encoder (A)** | 4-5 weeks | +400% (13.5x → 68x) | ✅ Yes (halfway there) |
| **Decoder (A)** | 4-5 weeks | +900% (68x → 220x) | ✅ Yes (goal achieved!) |

### Engineering Time Value

**Option B**: 2 weeks for 9% gain = **4.5% gain per week**
**Option A**: 12 weeks for 1600% gain = **133% gain per week**

**Option A is 30x better ROI!**

## What We Learned About NPU Mel Kernels

### Why They Don't Work Well for Mel Preprocessing

**1. DMA Overhead Dominates**
```
Computation time:    0.05-0.1ms (FFT + mel filters)
DMA overhead:        0.2-0.3ms (PCIe transfers)
Total:              0.25-0.4ms

DMA is 2-3x longer than computation!
```

**2. Small Operation Size**
- Input: 800 bytes (400 INT16 samples)
- Output: 80 bytes (80 INT8 mel bins)
- NPU excels at LARGE operations (like full encoder layers)

**3. Frame-by-Frame Processing**
- Can't normalize relative to max (need full spectrogram)
- librosa handles this elegantly on CPU
- NPU would need multi-pass approach (inefficient)

**4. CPU is Actually Fast Enough**
- librosa: 126x realtime (7.9ms per 1s audio)
- For 1 hour audio: 28 seconds preprocessing
- This is acceptable!

### When NPU Acceleration DOES Work

**Encoder/Decoder Characteristics**:
- ✅ Large operations: 768-dim embeddings, 32 attention heads
- ✅ Heavy compute: Matrix multiplications, attention, FFN
- ✅ Batch-friendly: Process multiple tokens together
- ✅ Stateful: KV cache can stay on NPU
- ✅ Long operations: NPU stays busy, DMA overhead amortized

**UC-Meeting-Ops Proof**:
- Uses librosa (CPU) for mel ✅
- Custom MLIR kernels for encoder/decoder ✅
- Achieves 220x realtime ✅
- This is the proven path!

## Technical Approach: Custom MLIR-AIE2 Kernels

### What We Already Have ✅

From this week's work:
- ✅ MLIR-AIE toolchain installed and working
- ✅ aiecc.py compilation pipeline (1.8s builds)
- ✅ XRT runtime integration
- ✅ NPU device access (`/dev/accel/accel0`)
- ✅ Test framework and validation suite
- ✅ Understanding of Q15/INT8 fixed-point math

### What We Need to Build

**1. Matrix Multiplication Kernel** (Core operation)
```mlir
// 768×768 matrix multiply in INT8
// Tile across NPU cores for parallelism
// Use local memory for weights
// Target: 50-100 TOPS effective
```

**2. Attention Kernel** (Most complex)
```mlir
// Q @ K^T / sqrt(d_k)
// Softmax
// @ V
// Multi-head parallel execution
```

**3. Layer Normalization** (Per-token)
```mlir
// Mean/variance computation
// Normalize and scale
// Efficient on NPU vector units
```

**4. Feed-Forward Network** (Large matmuls)
```mlir
// Linear: 768 → 3072 (GELU activation)
// Linear: 3072 → 768 (projection)
// Can fuse operations
```

### Reference Implementations

**We have successful examples**:
- `passthrough_complete.mlir` - Working DMA/compute template
- `mel_fixed_v3.xclbin` - Proven compilation process
- UC-Meeting-Ops approach - 220x target proven achievable

## Current Mel Kernel Status: Lessons Learned

### What We Fixed ✅

1. **FFT Scaling**: Per-stage >>1 scaling
   - Result: 1.0000 correlation (perfect)
   - Prevents INT16 overflow in 512-point FFT

2. **HTK Mel Filterbanks**: 207 KB coefficient table
   - Result: 0.38% error vs librosa
   - Proper triangular filter implementation

3. **Power Spectrum**: Magnitude squared
   - Result: Matches librosa `power=2.0`
   - Correct for Whisper mel spectrograms

4. **All Bins Active**: 80/80 bins producing values
   - Result: Proper energy distribution
   - Simple log2 compression achieved this

### What We Couldn't Solve (Yet) ⚠️

**Correlation Stuck at 50%**:
- Missing `ref=np.max` normalization
- librosa normalizes to global max across full spectrogram
- NPU processes frame-by-frame (can't see future frames)
- Would require multi-pass or global statistics

**Fundamental Challenge**:
```python
# librosa approach (CPU)
mel_spec = melspectrogram(audio)  # Process entire audio
mel_db = power_to_db(mel_spec, ref=np.max(mel_spec))  # Normalize to max
# NPU sees max from entire spectrogram

# NPU approach (frame-by-frame)
for frame in audio_frames:
    mel_frame = melspectrogram(frame)  # Only see this frame
    mel_db = power_to_db(mel_frame, ref=np.max(mel_frame))  # Different max!
    # Can't compare across frames properly
```

This is solvable but requires:
1. Two-pass approach (compute max, then normalize)
2. Or streaming with rolling statistics
3. Or accept approximate normalization

**Cost-benefit analysis**: 2 weeks work for 9% gain → Not worth it!
